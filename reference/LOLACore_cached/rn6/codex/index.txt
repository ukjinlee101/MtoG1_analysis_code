Cells were lysed by resuspending cell pellets in RIPA buffer (10mM Tris-HCl; pH8.0; 140 mM NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 0.1% SDS; 1% Deoxcholic acid sodium salt) and drawing the cell suspensions three times through a 30 gauge needle. Chromatin was sheared using a probe sonicator (130 W Ultrasonic Processor with a 3mm tip; 5?Ã—?60s at 30% maximum setting). Sonication quality was checked by gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations in the extracts were determined (BioRad DC Protein Assay Kit I # 500-111) and sonicated cell extracts containing 0.5 mg protein were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4oC. Immune complexes were recovered by incubation with a 50%-50% mix of magnetic beads coated with Protein A or Protein G (Dynabeads Protein A Invitrogen # 100.02D; Dynabeads Protein G Invitrogen # 100.04D). The magnetic beads were washed with RIPA buffer and the chromatin was eluted with 1% SDS in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0; 1 mM EDTA pH8.0) at 65oC for 15 min.

Briefly; 50x106 NPCs were lysed and chromatin was sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 250 for 30 x 12 sec pulses. Chromatin was pre-cleared with Protein A Sepharose beads and then immunoprecipitated with approximately 10 ÃŽÂ¼g of the appropriate antibody coupled to Protein A sepharose beads. For Smc1a ChIP using Bethyl Laboratories (A300-055A) affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody; beads were washed 1X with LB3; 1X with 20mM Tris-HCl pH8; 500mM NaCl; 2mM EDTA; 0.1% SDS; 1%Triton X-100; 1X with 10mM Tris-HCl pH8; 250nM LiCl; 2mM EDTA; 1% NP40 and 1X with TE containing 50 mM NaCl. For CTCF ChIP using an Upstate 07-729 rabbit polyclonal antibody; beads were washed 7 times with RIPA buffer and 1X with TE containing 50 mM NaCl. Bound complexes were eluted from the beads by heating at 65Ã‚Â°C for 15 min with occasional vortexing. Cross-links were reversed by overnight incubation at 65Ã‚Â°C. Whole cell extract DNA reserved from the sonication step was also treated for crosslink reversal. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared for sequencing as recommended by Illumina/Solexa.
